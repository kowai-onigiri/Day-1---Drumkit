# Day-1---Drumkit
This is my first project for JavaScrip30 by Wesbos.
After reviewing his HTML and CSS code, getting a feel for both and slightly modifying the stylesheet to fit my template, I followed his video tutorial
step-by-step to setup the script. 

I learned the following from this project:
(1) how to attach key events to certain actions
(2) how to add key events 
(3) how to use EventListener
(4) how to add and remove a class

Any Issues?
--At first, I couldn't figure out why the 'playing' class wouldn't remove according to the function. I had everything as it should be, and everything else was working properly. 
Finally, I moved the script to the bottom of the body tag instead of in the header tag, and that fixed it right up.
